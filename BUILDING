This BUILDING file covers how to build the three components included
in this distribution:
  - Compiler  (builds 'lqpl' and 'lqpl-compiler-server')
  - Emulator  (builds 'lqpl-emulator-server')

The Compiler and Emulator are Haskell programs. See http://github.com/drogar/lqpl-jruby-fe for a
GUI to use with the Compiler and Emulator servers. The lqpl-jruby-fe is a Java/JRuby
Swing program.

Use the command:

   stack build

to build all the Haskell components.

REQUIREMENTS:

For the Compiler and Emulator, you will need a recent version of Haskell
(tested with GHC version 8.8.3). The Stack build system will do this for
you (See https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/ for
installing Stack).

TESTS:

You can run all tests by typing:

    stack test

This will show two failures unless lqpl-compiler-server and lqpl-emulator-server are running.

TODO:
- Provide details of Docker images for the two servers
