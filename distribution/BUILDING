REQUIREMENTS:

You will need a recent version of Haskell (tested with GHC version 7.0.4 and 7.4.1). I suggest loading the
Haskell Platform at http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/.

If you choose to install individual pieces, you will need GHC, Happy, Alex and a variety of libraries.


BUILDING:

LQPL uses the Haskell default building system - CABAL. To build, run the following commands in
the same directory where the file 'Setup.hs' is located:

    runghc Setup.hs configure
    runghc Setup.hs build

Assuming everything runs correctly, you may now run

    runghc Setup.hs install

Note that by default, CABAL installs programs to a hidden subdirectory of your home directory. That is,
it will normally be installed to:

    {HOME}/.cabal/bin

To use the program, please add this directory to your path.

TESTS:
The tests use "hspec" in addition to other test modules in the haskell platform. To install it, type

    cabal update && cabal install hspec

You can build and run the tests in the following way:

    runghc Setup.hs configure --enable-tests
    runghc Setup.hs build
    runghc Setup.hs test

LQPL currently has 9 separate test suites, primarily covering the compiler server and emulator server.
A future version will add more tests and rationalize the test suites
