       can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We
       investigate the number of the above gates required to
       implement other gates, such as generalized
       Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2)
       transformation to one input bit if and only if the
       logical AND of all remaining input bits is satisfied.
       These gates play a central role in many proposed
       constructions of quantum computational networks. We
       derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of
       elementary gates required to build up a variety of two-
       and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number
       required for n-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some

       algorithms for factorising and counting, may be cast in
       this manner. Quantum searching is described as inducing
       a desired relative phase between two eigenvectors to
       yield constructive interference on the sought elements
       and destructive interference on the remaining terms.}
