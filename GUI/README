lqpl_gui is a front end for the Linear Quantum Programming Language developed
at the University of Calgary.

LQPL is a functional quantum programming language based on the semantics as
presented in "Towards a Quantum Programming Language" by Peter Selinger. LQPL is
available as a source distribution as well, at http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/lqpl

To run LQPL, open a terminal, change to the directory where you expanded the tar file
and type

'java -jar lqpl_gui.jar'

You will need to have a copy of the Java 6 runtime environment installed.

See the LICENCE file for the licence.

RELEASE NOTES:

v 0.9.0

This is the first release of LQPL to be made up of a separated GUI and back-end.

The front end is written in Java and JRuby to use Java Swing. The executable
is lqpl_gui.jar as noted above.

The back end is written in Haskell and is comprised of two main components
   - The Emulator (binary: lqpl-serv)
   - The Compiler (command line binary: lqpl; server binary: lqpl-compiler-server)

Each of the server pieces are required and are included in the binary distribution.

You may leave the binary servers as they are and use them through the lqpl_gui, or
you can copy the command line binary(lqpl) into a directory on your path and then
use it to compile lqpl programs.
